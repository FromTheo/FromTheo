## Welcome to my GitHub account! 

I'm passionate about **quantitative finance**, **machine learning**, and **stochastic modeling**.  
I enjoy implementing research papers, developing efficient numerical methods, and exploring the intersection between **maths and code**.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss research!
